# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing, I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added/changes to the code, please test this thoroughly.


Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this please:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed."
```


Thank you.
